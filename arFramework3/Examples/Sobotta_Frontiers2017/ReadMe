This folder contains the model corresponding to the publication:
"Model Based Targeting of IL-6-Induced Inflammatory Responses in Cultured Primary Hepatocytes to Improve Application of the JAK Inhibitor Ruxolitinib" in Frontiers in Physiology.
See: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00775

Setup_IL6_Core only compiles the core model against its data. This is quite time intensive.
Setup_IL6_ExpDesign compiles the model suitable for experiment design. Here multiple boluses of Ruxolitinib and IL-6 can be applied.
Setup_IL6_Full compiles the full model including the APP gene submodules. This is very time intensive.

doSensitivityAnalysis performs a sensitivity analysis on the model and is meant to be run with the ExpDesign model.
saveAllFigs reproduces all figures from the paper and is meant to be run with the full model. Warning: this is extremely time intensive.

Some of the analysis results were too big for the repository. These can be found at: sysbio.uni-freiburg.de/jvanlier/hidden_IL6_343249/IL6_Model_BigFiles.zip
If you put these files in a subdirectory BigFiles, the larger analysis should also display.
