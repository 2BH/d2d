This model was developed in D2D ( https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d ). In the original model, states are pre-equilibrated based on parameters describing the total pools or production and degradation rates of certain moieties (total STAT3, gp130 production/degradation). Since this functionality is absent in the SBML standard, we have provided pre-equilibrated concentrations based on the optimal parameter set in the SBML file. For the original model (including all of the data), please download D2D.

The simulation were checked to be in exact accordance with the D2D version of the model.
