A new best fit was found in Nov 2018 and replaces the old "BestFit".
The previous one was renamed as "BestFit_Deprecated".

It is possible to further improve the current "BestFit" because it seems that estimation of the delay parameters does not work properly. The reason might be wrong calculation of the derivatives. This has to be fixed in the future.
